<h1>Games:</h1>
<p1>I have made a lot of different games in my free time using the Godot game engine, which are all posted on itch.io. They were all made for game competitions hosted online.<br></p1>
<h3>Blok<br></h3>
<p1>This game is my most complete one so far. It is a small puzzle platformer and was made in around 2 days.<br></p1>

<h3>Mecon<br></h3>
<p1>This game was my most recent one. It is a sort of exploration game but is very short. It took around 7 days.<br></p1>

<p1>This game I have spent the most time on, which is about ~20 days. It is a topdown shooter boss rush and visualy the game im most proud of.<br></p1>

<h3>A-Bounce-around<br></h3>
<p1>This was my first experiment with the Godot engine. It's a very simple game but it does work.<br></p1>

<h3>2.5D raycaster<br></h3>
<p1>This is a program that runs a 3D perspective of a 2D space using Java. It's not perfect and is quite unoptimized but I am quite proud of it.<br></p1>
